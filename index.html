			In the October 2015 General Conference, Elder Neil L. Andersen asked listeners to "give brother Joseph a break". You can watch the his talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OvYJKGlz1A&t=7m2s" target="_blank">here</a>.
		</p>
		<p class="lead">
			
			Elder Andersen tells us that the questions concerning Joseph Smith are not new. He goes on to say that 
			people in the 21st century seem unqualified to question Joseph's actions due to the fact that these things occurred nearly 200 years ago.
			Given the differences between cultural and social norms of today and 200 years ago, Elder Andersen asks that we give Joseph a break.

			Elder Andersen did not list the things for which Joseph may be entitled to a break so we will list them here.

        </div>
        <div class="timeline-body">
          <p>
            The church recently released an <a href="https://www.lds.org/topics/first-vision-accounts">essay</a> on the different versions of the <a href="http://mormonthink.com/firstvisionweb.htm">First Version</a>.
            As stated in the essay, "Joseph's First Vision accounts describe the heavenly beings with greater detail over time".
            The <a href="http://mormonthink.com/firstvisionweb.htm#differentversions">details of the accounts vary</a> between just seeing angels, a single angel, the Lord alone, and God together with Jesus. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The First Vision also <a href="http://mormonthink.com/firstvisionweb.htm#taught">wasn't taught or emphasized</a> during Joseph's lifetime. As it turns out,
            these types of visions were <a href="http://mormonthink.com/firstvisionweb.htm#having">common among religious groups</a> in the early 1800's.

        <div class="timeline-body">
          <p>
            The use of a <a href="https://www.lds.org/bc/content/shared/content/images/magazines/ensign/2015/10/seer-stone-joseph-smith-ensign-liahona-october-2015_1512979_inl.jpg">seer stone</a> to translate the Book of Mormon was mainly believed to be an anti-Mormon myth. The church recently <a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2015/10/joseph-the-seer?lang=eng">released an 
            article in the Ensign</a> about the seer stone and the fact that Joseph used it to translate the Book of Mormon. The church also released an <a href="https://www.lds.org/topics/book-of-mormon-translation?lang=eng">essay
            on the Book of Mormon translation</a> and it mentions the seer stone as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to using the stone to translate the Book of Mormon, Joseph also used the stone for <a href="http://en.fairmormon.org/Joseph_Smith/Money_digging">treasure hunting expeditions</a>. He employed the same method used to
            translate the Book of Mormon when he was seeking treasure. He would place the <a href="http://en.fairmormon.org/Joseph_Smith/Seer_stones/%22Rock_in_hat%22_used_for_Book_of_Mormon_translation">stone in a hat and put his face in the hat</a> to read what was written
            on the stone.

        <div class="timeline-body">
          <p>
            Between the <a href="https://www.lds.org/topics/book-of-mormon-translation?lang=eng">essay on the Book of Mormon translation</a> 
            and the <a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2015/10/joseph-the-seer?lang=eng">article on the seer stone</a>, the picture of how
            the Book of Mormon was translated is different than the version taught on a day to day basis in the Church.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fact that the entire Book of Mormon, at least after the lost 116 pages, <a href="http://mormonstories.org/307-311-translating-the-book-of-mormon-with-brant-gardner/">was translated using the seer stone</a> may come as a 
            surprise to most members of the church. Perhaps the church deserves a break for allowing artists to misrepresent the translation process in all of
            the art and movies that have been created that show the process. If you read the <a href="https://www.lds.org/ensign/2015/10/joseph-the-seer?lang=eng">article on the seer stone</a>, the church actually shifts the blame
            for the incorrect art on the artists. Certainly the Church was involved in the creative process.

          <p>
            Of the 33 documented wives of Joseph Smith, <a href="http://en.fairmormon.org/Polygamy_book/Polyandry">11 of them were already married</a> to other living men.
            Joseph <a href="http://mormonthink.com/joseph-smith-polygamy.htm#other">married Orson Hyde's wife</a>, Miranda Johnson Hyde, while Orson was on a mission to the Holy Land.
            One of the reasons used to justify polygamy today was that many Mormon women needed righteous husbands. Orson
            was a righteous man and was away serving a mission for the Lord. Why did Joseph need to marry Orson's wife?
